Set up an AWS account: No code steps required. This is the initial setup process.
Create an IAM role: No code steps required. This is done through the AWS Management Console.
Create a Lambda function:
Go to the Lambda service in the AWS Management Console.
Click on "Create function".
Choose "Author from scratch".
Provide a name for your function.
Select the Python runtime.
Choose the IAM role you created in step 2.
Click on "Create function".
In the function's code editor, write or copy-paste the code you provided in your initial question.
Configure the Lambda function:
In the function's configuration, scroll down to the "Designer" section.
Click on "Add trigger".
Select "CloudWatch Events" from the trigger options.
Click on "Create a new rule".
Configure the rule to trigger whenever a new volume is created. You can use a CloudWatch Events pattern to filter for the specific event you're interested in (e.g., volume creation with a specific tag).
Click on "Add".
Save the function.
Test the Lambda function:
Create a new volume in your AWS account that matches the trigger conditions you set in step 4.
Go to the CloudWatch Logs service in the AWS Management Console.
Find the log group associated with your Lambda function.
Check the logs for your function to see if it executed successfully and if any errors occurred.
Verify the volume modification:
After the Lambda function is triggered, it should extract the volume ID from the event and attempt to modify the volume type to gp3.
Check the CloudWatch Logs again to see if the modification was successful.
You can also verify in the AWS Management Console by checking the volume's properties.
